          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>We use the Present Simple tense when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the action is general</li>
            <li>
              the action happens all the time, or habitually, in the past,
              present and future
            </li>
            <li>the action is not only happening now</li>
            <li>the statement is always true</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            We use the Past Simple tense to talk about an action or a situation
            - an event - in the past. The event can be short or long.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, if we say the past time or place of the event, we must
            use the Past Simple tense; we cannot use the present perfect.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I lived in that house when I was young.</li>

            <li>was/were + S + V-ing</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            The Past Continuous tense expresses action at a particular moment in
            the past. The action started before that moment but has not finished
            at that moment.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, yesterday I watched a film on TV. The film started at
            7pm and finished at 9pm.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>
            When we use the Past Continuous tense, our listener usually knows or
            understands what time we are talking about. Look at these examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I was working at 10pm last night.</li>
            <li>They were not playing football at 9am this morning.</li>
            <li>What were you doing at 10pm last night?</li>
            <li>What were you doing when he arrived?</li>
            <li>She was cooking when I telephoned her.</li>
            <li>We were having dinner when it started to rain.</li>
            <li>Ram went home early because it was snowing.</li>

            <li>had + S + V3/ed?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            The Past Perfect tense expresses action in the past before another
            action in the past. This is the past in the past.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            For example: The train left at 9am. We arrived at 9:15am. When we
            arrived, the train had left.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I wasn't hungry. I had just eaten.</li>
            <li>They were hungry. They had not eaten for five hours.</li>
            <li>I didn't know who he was. I had never seen him before.</li>
            <li>
              "Mary wasn't at home when I arrived." / "Really? Where had she
              gone?"
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We often use the Past Perfect in reported speech after verbs like:
            said, told, asked, thought, wondered
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>He told us that the train had left.</li>
            <li>I thought I had met her before, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>
              He explained that he had closed the window because of the rain.
            </li>
            <li>I wondered if I had been there before.</li>
            <li>I asked them why they had not finished.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

          </ol>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            The Past Perfect Continuous tense is like the Past Perfect tense,
            but it expresses longer actions in the past before another action in
            the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example: Ram started waiting at 9am. I arrived at 11am. When I
            arrived, Ram had been waiting for two hours.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>John was very tired. He had been running.</li>
            <li>I could smell cigarettes. Somebody had been smoking.</li>
            <li>
              Suddenly, my car broke down. I was not surprised. It had not been
              running well for a long time.
            </li>

          </ol>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <h2>No Plan:</h2>
          <p>
            We use the Future Simple tense when there is no plan or decision to
            do something before we speak. We make the decision spontaneously at
            the time of speaking. Look at these examples:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Hold on. I'll get a pen.</li>
            <li>We will see what we can do to help you.</li>
            <li>Maybe we'll stay in and watch television tonight.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In these examples, we had no firm plan before speaking. The decision
            is made at the time of speaking.
          </p>

          <p>
            We often use the Future Simple tense with the verb to think before
            it:
          </p>

          <li>I think I'll go to the gym tomorrow.</li>
          <li>I think I will have a holiday next year.</li>
          <li>I don't think I'll buy that car.</li>
          <h2>Prediction</h2>
          <p>
            We often use the Future Simple tense to make a prediction about the
            future. Again, there is no firm plan. We are saying what we think
            will happen. Here are some examples:
          </p>

          <li>It will rain tomorrow.</li>
          <li>People won't go to Jupiter before the 22nd century.</li>
          <li>Who do you think will get the job?</li>
          <h2>Be</h2>
          <p>
            When the main verb is be, we can use the Future Simple tense even if
            we have a firm plan or decision before speaking. Examples:
          </p>

          <li>I'll be in London tomorrow.</li>
          <li>I'm going shopping. I won't be very long.</li>
          <li>Will you be at work tomorrow?</li>

          </ol>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            The Future Continuous tense expresses action at a particular moment
            in the future. The action will have started before that moment but
            it will not have finished at that moment. For example, tomorrow I
            will start work at 2pm and stop work at 6pm. At 4pm tomorrow, I will
            be working.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>
            When we use the Future Continuous tense, our listener usually knows
            or understands what time we are talking about. Look at these
            examples:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I will be playing tennis at 10am tomorrow.</li>
            <li>They won't be watching TV at 9pm tonight.</li>
            <li>What will you be doing at 10pm tonight?</li>
            <li>What will you be doing when I arrive?</li>
            <li>She will not be sleeping when you telephone her.</li>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            The Future Perfect tense expresses action in the future before
            another action in the future. This is the past in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example: The train will leave the station at 9am. You will
            arrive at the station at 9.15am. When you arrive, the train will
            have left. => The train will have left when you arrive.
          </p>

          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can call me at work at 8am. I will have arrived at the office
              by 8.
            </li>
            <li>
              They will be tired when they arrive. They will not have slept for
              a long time.
            </li>
            <li>
              "Mary won't be at home when you arrive." / "Really? Where will she
              have gone?"
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Usage:</h3>
          <p>
            We sometimes use shall instead of will, especially for I and we.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Future Perfect Continuous tense is like the Future Perfect
            tense, but it expresses longer actions or states extending up to
            some specific event or time in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example: Ram starts waiting at 9am. I am late and cannot arrive
            before 10am. Ram will have been waiting for an hour by the time I
            meet him.
          </p>
          <p>=> Ram will have been waiting for one hour when I arrive.</p>
          <p>
            Notice that the long action or state can start at any time in the
            past, present or future, but of course it always ends in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            => Next Monday we will have been living here for exactly five years.
